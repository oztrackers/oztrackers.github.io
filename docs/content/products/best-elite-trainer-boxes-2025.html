    <p>
        Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs) remain one of the most popular Pokémon TCG products. They offer a mix of booster packs, dice, sleeves, and promo cards, making them attractive to both collectors and players. In 2025, several standout ETBs have been released that combine great value with strong collectability.
    </p>

    <h2>Why ETBs are a smart purchase</h2>
    <p>
        ETBs are often more than just booster packs in a box. They include exclusive sleeves, dice, condition markers, and sometimes unique promos that don’t appear elsewhere. For Australian collectors, ETBs also tend to restock more frequently than booster boxes, making them easier to find at retail prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Top ETBs of 2025</h2>
    <h3>Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: Stellar Mirage ETB</h3>
    <p>
        This ETB features stunning artwork of Miraidon and Koraidon, with 9 booster packs and exclusive metallic dice. Collectors love the cosmic-themed sleeves, while competitive players appreciate the consistent value in the included packs.
    </p>

    <h3>Pokémon 151 Anniversary ETB (2025 Print)</h3>
    <p>
        The re-release of the Pokémon 151 ETB is a highlight for long-term collectors. Packed with fan-favourite Kanto Pokémon artwork, this ETB combines nostalgia with fresh print quality. It continues to sell out quickly across Australian retailers.
    </p>

    <h3>Neo Reborn ETB</h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by the classic Neo Genesis era, the Neo Reborn ETB offers a modern spin with holo-foil dice, vintage-inspired sleeves, and a chance at iconic Johto Pokémon pulls.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to buy ETBs in Australia</h2>
    <p>
        ETBs are available at major retailers like <a href="https://www.ebgames.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EB Games</a>, <a href="https://www.zingpopculture.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zing Pop Culture</a>, and online at <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Australia</a>. Specialist hobby shops and independent TCG stores often offer bundles or early preorders for high-demand sets.
    </p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        Whether you are a new player looking for accessories or a collector chasing promos, ETBs remain one of the best ways to enjoy the Pokémon TCG. The 2025 releases have something for everyone — from nostalgic reprints to cutting-edge designs — making this year an excellent time to pick one up.
