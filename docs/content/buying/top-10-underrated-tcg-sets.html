    <p>
        The secondary market for trading card games is noisy - hype gravitates toward the newest releases - but smart collectors and players often find the best opportunities in underrated sets. Below are 10 TCG sets across multiple games and print runs that are currently overlooked in Australia, with reasons to consider buying, what to look for, and where to source them locally.
    </p>

    <h2>1 - Pokémon - Scarlet & Violet: Obsidian Flames</h2>
    <p>
        Obsidian Flames introduced several playable staples and alt-art cards that didn't initially attract mainstream hype. Hunt sealed booster bundles or premium singles for mid-term growth as the meta evolves. For Australian buyers, local e-tailers and independent game stores often have leftover allocations at RRP or small premiums.
    </p>

    <h2>2 - Pokémon - Lost Origins</h2>
    <p>
        Lost Origins contains high-value reprints and sought foil patterns, but many collectors focused on other sets at release. Singles from Lost Origins, especially alt-art trainers and rare foils, can be found on marketplace sites at reasonable prices and represent a good buy for grading or resale.
    </p>

    <h2>3 - Yu-Gi-Oh! - Eternity Code</h2>
    <p>
        Eternity Code added strong support cards that later found competitive play. Because many players chase newer sets, Eternity Code supplies have softened, making sealed product and singles undervalued. Check Australian auction listings and independent retailers for bargains.
    </p>

    <h2>4 - Pokémon - Astral Radiance</h2>
    <p>
        Astral Radiance has useful support cards and a number of niche chase arts. Post-release attention dipped fast, creating an opportunity for buyers to pick up sealed boxes or graded singles at lower cost than similar-era releases.
    </p>

    <h2>5 - Digimon Card Game - Union Collide</h2>
    <p>
        Digimon remains a niche in Australia compared with Pokémon or Magic, and Union Collide is an example of a solid set that flew under most collectors' radars. If you follow Digimon communities, you can find singles and sealed lots priced attractively for both play and collection.
    </p>

    <h2>6 - Magic: The Gathering - Strixhaven Commander</h2>
    <p>
        Commander-focused products like Strixhaven Commander often have long tails of demand. Many casual players skipped the initial run, leaving sealed commander decks and boxed products at softer prices - good purchases for players or speculators targeting playgroup demand.
    </p>

    <h2>7 - Pokémon - Fusion Strike (selected print runs)</h2>
    <p>
        Fusion Strike standard boosters had strong early interest, but select print variants and promos didn’t get as much attention. Target specific chase cards and promos which can appreciate with renewed interest in competitive formats.
    </p>

    <h2>8 - Pokémon - Shining Fates Singles</h2>
    <p>
        Shining Fates was widely opened, but some of its chase singles and shiny promos remain undervalued compared to their long-term potential. For Australian buyers, sourcing graded copies or high-quality raw singles from reputable sellers is the safest route.
    </p>

    <h2>9 - Flesh and Blood - Crucible of War</h2>
    <p>
        Flesh and Blood is still growing in Australian tabletop scenes. Crucible of War contains key playables and art variants that are not yet widely recognised by the mainstream. Buying sealed or singles now can be attractive for players building competitive lists.
    </p>

    <h2>10 - Pokémon - Classic Reprints and Anniversary Sets</h2>
    <p>
        Anniversary-style reprints and retro packs often slip under the radar when released between major expansions. These products carry long-term nostalgia appeal and sometimes limited print runs, making them a subtle but smart buy - especially if you can source domestic stock to avoid import complications.
    </p>

    <h2>How to pick which underrated set to buy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decide your goal</strong> - playability, long-term collectability, or quick flips influence your set choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Check local demand</strong> - search Australian marketplace completed listings to verify interest and price history.</li>
        <li><strong>Prefer domestic stock</strong> - avoids long shipping delays and unexpected import costs for Australian buyers.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on sealed product for investment</strong> - singles are great for tactical plays, sealed product protects scarcity value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to source these sets in Australia</h2>
    <p>
        - Independent game stores are excellent for provenance and preorders. <br>
        - Major chains like JB Hi-Fi, Big W and Kmart occasionally carry bundles and premium boxes at RRP. <br>
        - Marketplace sites like eBay Australia and local Facebook groups are useful for singles and bulk lots - always verify seller feedback and request clear photos. <br>
        - Specialty online retailers and auction houses often list graded singles and sealed rarities.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical buying tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preorder or buy from trusted retailers where possible to lock in RRP.</li>
        <li>When buying from marketplaces, request high-resolution photos and tracked postage for high-value items.</li>
        <li>Consider grading for rare singles to increase resale trust and long-term value.</li>
        <li>Buy in lots or bulk to reduce per-item shipping costs when ordering from outside Australia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Hunting underrated sets rewards patience and research. The 10 sets above represent a mix of play-focused, collector-focused and niche TCG releases that are undervalued relative to their potential. Australian buyers who prioritise domestic stock, reputable sellers and clear buying goals will find the best bargains - and often the most enjoyable additions to their collections.
