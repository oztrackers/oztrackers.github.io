    <p>
        Trading card playmats are often overlooked, but they are one of the best accessories you can buy for both protection and playability. Whether you’re competing in a Pokémon TCG tournament or simply enjoying casual games with friends, a playmat keeps your cards safe and your setup professional.
    </p>

    <h2>Why playmats matter</h2>
    <p>
        Cards placed directly on tables are exposed to scratches, spills, and bending. A soft playmat provides a clean, cushioned surface that prevents damage. For collectors, this means keeping cards in top condition even during heavy play.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of a playmat</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protection</strong> – Avoid scuffs, dirt, and table residue.</li>
        <li><strong>Organisation</strong> – Many playmats have printed zones to help new players set up correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort</strong> – The padded neoprene surface makes longer play sessions more enjoyable.</li>
        <li><strong>Style</strong> – Playmats are customisable, letting players show off their favourite Pokémon or designs.</li>
    </ul>
