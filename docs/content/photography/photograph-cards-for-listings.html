    <p>
        Good photos are the single most important factor in selling trading cards online. Clear, accurate images reduce disputes, attract more buyers, and let you command better prices. You don’t need professional studio gear to get excellent results - this guide shows a cheap, repeatable setup and a comprehensive checklist of shots and settings so your listings stand out on eBay Australia, Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree and local auction sites.
    </p>

    <h2>1 - Minimal gear you need</h2>
    <p>
        You can create high-quality photos with very small investment. Recommended baseline gear:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smartphone with a decent camera</strong> - Modern phones (iPhone or Android mid-range and above) are perfectly adequate.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheap light source</strong> - Two daylight-balanced LED panels or even bright daylight lamps with diffusers. Aim for 5000K to 6500K colour temperature if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Tripod or stable stand</strong> - Keeps framing consistent and sharp; affordable phone tripods work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Macro lens clip</strong> (optional) - A cheap clip-on macro lens helps capture fine text and print detail on the card face and edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Background</strong> - A neutral, non-reflective surface such as white foamboard or black card depending on card colours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2 - Cheap lighting setups that work</h2>
    <p>
        Lighting is the most important variable. The goal is even, shadow-free illumination that shows colours accurately.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two-light setup (recommended)</strong> - Place two lights at 45-degree angles in front of the card to eliminate harsh shadows. Diffuse with white sheets or inexpensive softboxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Window daylight method</strong> - If you lack lights, use indirect daylight near a north-facing window (Southern Hemisphere note - avoid direct mid-day sun). Place a white reflector opposite the window to fill shadows.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid on-camera flash</strong> - It creates hotspots and reflects on glossy sleeves; use off-camera soft light instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3 - Staging and background</h2>
    <p>
        Keep the focus on the card. Use a plain background that contrasts with card edges and prevents reflections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>White foamboard for darker cards, black for lighter cards.</li>
        <li>Place the card flat or slightly propped at a low angle for a dynamic shot, but ensure the full face is visible.</li>
        <li>If shooting graded slabs, ensure no distracting reflections by angling the slab slightly and using cross-polarised lighting if available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4 - Camera settings and composition</h2>
    <p>
        Basic camera settings to prioritise:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stability</strong> - Use a tripod and timer to avoid handshake blur.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus</strong> - Tap-to-focus on the card face (or use manual focus for macro lens).</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure</strong> - Slightly underexpose if highlights blow out; adjust with exposure lock.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution</strong> - Use the highest native resolution and avoid digital zoom.</li>
        <li><strong>Aspect ratio</strong> - Shoot in 4:3 or original sensor ratio; marketplaces will crop thumbnails anyway, but keep the full-resolution original for downloads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5 - The mandatory photo checklist for every listing</h2>
    <p>
        Always include these shots to reduce buyer questions and disputes:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Full front</strong> - clear, straight-on photo of the card face showing the entire card and borders.}</li>
        <li><strong>Full back</strong> - critical to prove authenticity and show print pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Edges and corners close-ups</strong> - 2-4 close photos showing corner wear, whitening, or dings.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface close-up</strong> - a macro shot showing gloss, scratches, print detail, or foil pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Graded slab photo (if applicable)</strong> - front and back of the slab with the grade visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Scale reference</strong> - place the card next to a ruler or coin for high-value items if buyers commonly request it.</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamped hand or note (optional)</strong> - for high-value single listings, a small handwritten note with date and your username in the photo helps prove item possession.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6 - Quick editing - keep it honest</h2>
    <p>
        Use light edits to improve clarity but do not mislead buyers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crop and straighten - remove unnecessary margins but show the whole card.</li>
        <li>Adjust exposure and white balance - make colours accurate to real life.</li>
        <li>Avoid heavy sharpening or healing that removes blemishes - buyers want to see imperfections.</li>
        <li>Export as high-quality JPG or PNG - aim for 1000-2000px on the long edge so marketplaces generate clear thumbnails.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7 - File naming and upload tips</h2>
    <p>
        Name files descriptively (e.g., "1999-Charizard-Holo-front.jpg") and upload several images in the order buyers expect - front, back, corners, close-ups, extras. For eBay Australia and similar platforms, mark the highest-quality front image as the gallery thumbnail.
    </p>

    <h2>8 - Special notes for graded cards and slabs</h2>
    <p>
        When photographing graded slabs, avoid angled reflections. Use a polarising filter or adjust the lights slightly off-axis. Include the slab's serial number in one of the photos and a close-up of the grade label.
    </p>

    <h2>9 - Market-specific considerations for Australian sellers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>eBay Australia</strong> - buyers expect multiple clear images and tracked shipping for higher-value cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Marketplace & Gumtree</strong> - include pickup availability photos and honest notes about condition to avoid in-person disputes.</li>
        <li><strong>International sales</strong> - if shipping overseas, photograph packaging materials you will use to reassure buyers about safe transit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10 - Troubleshooting common photo problems</h2>
    <p>
        Reflection - move lights further away and diffuse with white paper. Soft focus - increase shutter stability and use a tripod. Colour cast - set white balance manually or use auto white-balance with a neutral reference card.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary - quick checklist to copy-paste</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tripod, two lights (or bright indirect daylight), neutral background</li>
        <li>Front, back, corners, surface close-ups, slab label if graded</li>
        <li>High-resolution export, honest edits, descriptive filenames</li>
        <li>Tracked postage and photo of packaging for higher-value listings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Good photos reduce disputes and increase buyer confidence. With a modest setup and consistent checklist, you can create professional-looking listings that sell faster and for better prices in the Australian market.
