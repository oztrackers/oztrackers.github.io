  <h2>Research local comparable sales</h2>
  <p>Search completed listings on local platforms to determine what similar cards recently sold for. Adjust for condition and grading.</p>
  <h2>Account for fees and postage</h2>
  <p>Deduct marketplace fees and estimate postage costs to find your net profit. Factor these into the listing price or offer clear combined shipping terms.</p>
  <h2>Seasonal and regional effects</h2>
  <p>Demand can change with local events, holidays or new set releases. Price accordingly if there's temporary demand spike.</p>
  <h2>Final pricing checks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>List slightly above your desired net to allow for offers.</li>
    <li>Offer clear returns or 'no returns' policies to match buyer expectations.</li>
  </ul>
