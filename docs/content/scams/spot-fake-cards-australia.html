  <h2>Visual and print checks</h2>
  <p>Compare suspected cards to verified originals - look for incorrect colours, fuzzy printing, or off-centre borders. Counterfeits often have muted or oversaturated tones compared to official prints.</p>
  <h2>Weight and card stock</h2>
  <p>Authentic cards use specific card stock. If you can, compare weight and stiffness to a known genuine card. Counterfeits can feel flimsier or bend differently.</p>
  <h2>Holograms and security marks</h2>
  <p>Many legitimate cards include foil patterns, holographic stamps, or set-specific security marks. Research known markers for the set you are buying and inspect under good lighting.</p>
  <h2>Seller reputation and photos</h2>
  <p>Ask sellers for detailed photos of the card edges, back, and front. Request scans if possible. Poor-quality or low-resolution images are a red flag.</p>
  <h2>When in doubt</h2>
  <p>Seek a second opinion from reputable grading services or experienced local retailers. For high-value purchases consider professional authentication.</p>
