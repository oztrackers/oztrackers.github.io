    <p>
        The market for trading cards is bigger than ever in Australia, and unfortunately counterfeit cards are part of that growth. Whether you are buying singles, sealed packs, or high-value graded cards, a few simple checks can drastically reduce your risk of buying fakes. This guide covers practical visual checks, simple at-home tests, how to vet sellers in Australian marketplaces, and when to pursue professional authentication.
    </p>

    <h2>1 - First-line visual checks (what to look for immediately)</h2>
    <p>
        Start with a careful visual inspection. Many counterfeit cards fail obvious appearance and print-quality tests:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Colour and clarity</strong> - Compare the card to an image of a confirmed genuine example. Fakes often show muted or oversaturated tones, fuzzy printing, or incorrect contrast.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Borders and centring</strong> - Check the white or black border alignment. Genuine prints have consistent border widths and tight tolerances; obvious mis-centred borders are a red flag.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Font and text</strong> - Look closely at mana/attack text, rarity symbols, and small-print fonts. Counterfeits often use slightly different fonts or spacing that becomes clear under magnification.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Back pattern and sheen</strong> - The card back pattern (dot matrix or texture) and gloss should match a verified card from the same set. In particular, Pokémon cards have a distinct back colour and sheen; an incorrect back almost always indicates a fake.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Holograms and foils</strong> - For holographic cards inspect the foil pattern. Counterfeits often use a single, generic foil rather than the set-specific patterns used by manufacturers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2 - Handling and feel tests</h2>
    <p>
        The way a card feels tells you a lot. At-home handling checks are fast and revealing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Card stock and stiffness</strong> - Genuine cards have a specific thickness and stiffness. If a card feels flimsy or bends differently from an authentic reference, be suspicious.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Light test</strong> - Hold the card up to a bright light. Many genuine cards show a specific internal light transmission; poor lamination or a different internal layer will appear under direct light on fakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Corner and edge finish</strong> - Genuine cards usually have smooth, well-rounded corners. Rough, uneven, or soft corners can indicate counterfeit manufacturing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Weight</strong> - If you can compare to a known-good card, small weight differences can be a clue. For very high-value cards this can be a useful extra check.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3 - Magnification and print detail</h2>
    <p>
        Use a loupe, magnifying glass, or even a phone camera zoom to inspect fine details:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Dot pattern / lithography</strong> - Under magnification genuine prints show manufacturer-expected dot patterns and print textures. Some counterfeits reveal large, irregular dots or inconsistent patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Microprint and registration</strong> - Many modern cards have microprint or tightly registered elements. Misregistered artwork or missing microprint can indicate a fake.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Barcode and SKU checks</strong> - For sealed products, confirm the barcode and SKU match official releases. Retailer product pages and manufacturer announcements often list SKU codes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4 - Packaging and sealed product cues</h2>
    <p>
        When buying sealed booster boxes, tins, or packs, packaging is a common counterfeit target. Check:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Heat seals and shrinkwrap</strong> - Authentic products usually have consistent shrinkwrap tension, straight heat seals, and manufacturer stickers. Crooked seals or excess glue often indicate tampering or resealing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Box print quality</strong> - Check the box art, gloss, and embossing against official release photos. Blurry artwork or dull colours are red flags.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bundle contents</strong> - For sealed bundles verify the listed contents match the packaging insert and that serial stickers or promo codes (if present) are intact.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5 - Vetting online sellers and marketplace listings</h2>
    <p>
        The majority of counterfeit encounters happen during online purchases. Use these seller-vetting steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Seller feedback</strong> - On eBay Australia and similar platforms, prioritise sellers with long histories and high positive feedback. Read recent comments specifically about high-value cards.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Request extra photos</strong> - Ask for high-resolution, well-lit images of the front, back, edges, and any serial numbers, seals, or holograms. Insist on photos that include a timestamped hand or note if you suspect fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Payment safety</strong> - Use platforms with buyer protection and avoid direct bank transfers to unknown sellers. Tracked postage and signature-on-delivery add security for both buyer and seller.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Check listing history</strong> - If possible, view the seller's other listings. Repeated identical images across many sellers can indicate the images are stolen or reused by scalpers and counterfeit sellers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6 - Simple tests you can do at home (and what to avoid)</h2>
    <p>
        A few safe checks are useful, but avoid destructive tests that reduce resale value:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Water drop test - avoid</strong> - Do not apply liquids to cards you may resell; many "water tests" are destructive and will void grading or resale potential.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Blacklight/UV check</strong> - Some cards or security stickers react under UV. While not universal, a UV check can reveal certain types of fakery in packaging or holographic effects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compare to a known genuine card</strong> - The side-by-side comparison is the single most reliable at-home technique. Use a trusted card from the same set as reference.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7 - When to seek professional authentication or grading</h2>
    <p>
        For high-value singles or boxes you plan to resell at scale, professional grading and authentication remove most doubt. Reputable graders include PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) and Beckett - both accept Australian submissions via local drop-off or international mail. Grading provides an objective assessment of authenticity and condition and increases buyer confidence on the secondary market.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Use accredited services</strong> - Only use established third-party grading companies with clear submission and return policies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Keep documentation</strong> - Record seller details, listing screenshots, and shipping receipts; graders may require provenance information for disputes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8 - Red flags that almost always mean "no"</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Price dramatically below the market with vague seller details.</li>
        <li>Seller refuses to provide clear photos on request.</li>
        <li>Unusual packaging, misspelled logos, or inconsistent fonts on box art.</li>
        <li>No tracking on postage for higher-value cards or sellers who pressure for direct transfers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9 - Practical checklist before you buy (quick reference)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Compare listing photos to a verified genuine example from the same set.</li>
        <li>Inspect borders, fonts, holograms, and back pattern under magnification.</li>
        <li>Request extra photos showing edges, back, and any serial numbers or seals.</li>
        <li>Prefer sellers with strong feedback and tracked postage options.</li>
        <li>For high-value cards consider professional grading before completing the purchase.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Counterfeits are an unfortunate reality, but with careful inspection, sensible seller vetting, and a willingness to walk away from suspicious deals, you can dramatically reduce risk. For very valuable purchases, invest in professional grading and insist on tracked, insured shipping so you are covered if something goes wrong.
