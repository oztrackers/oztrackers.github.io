  <h2>Creating strong listings</h2>
  <p>Use clear titles, high-resolution photos, and full condition descriptions. Include 'graded' or 'ungraded' where applicable and list any imperfections.</p>
  <h2>Auction vs Buy-it-Now</h2>
  <p>Auctions can drive competitive bids but require careful reserve planning. Buy-it-Now gives immediate sales at set prices - combine with 'Best Offer' for flexibility.</p>
  <h2>Feedback and reputation</h2>
  <p>Check buyer/seller feedback before transacting. High positive feedback and prompt communication reduce risk for both parties.</p>
  <h2>Handling disputes</h2>
  <p>Document condition with photos and communicate quickly. Use eBay's resolution tools and keep postage receipts and tracking for evidence.</p>
  <h2>Postage tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always offer tracked postage for higher-value items.</li>
    <li>Consider combined shipping discounts for multiple purchases from the same buyer.</li>
  </ul>
