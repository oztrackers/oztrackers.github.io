  <h2>Packaging basics</h2>
  <p>Use a soft sleeve, top loader or semi-rigid holder, and a rigid mailer to protect corners and edges. For single cards, the standard stack is: penny sleeve, top loader, taped, then placed in a rigid card mailer with cardboard stiffeners.</p>
  <h2>Postage and tracking</h2>
  <p>Choose tracked postage for all but the lowest-value sales. Australia Post offers regular tracked services and some private couriers provide competitive rates—compare pricing based on weight and distance.</p>
  <h2>Insurance and declared value</h2>
  <p>Declare value and insure shipments for high-value cards. Some platforms offer seller protection only when tracked and insured postage is used.</p>
  <h2>Packaging suppliers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Buy sleeves, top loaders and mailers in bulk to lower per-item cost.</li>
    <li>Consider combined postage discounts for multiple items sent together.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Tips for smooth transactions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Take clear photos of the packaged card before posting.</li>
    <li>Keep receipts and tracking numbers and update the buyer promptly.</li>
    <li>Use signature on delivery for very high-value items.</li>
  </ol>
