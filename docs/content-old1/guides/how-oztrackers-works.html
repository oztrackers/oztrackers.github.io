<h1>How OzTrackers Works - A Quick Start for Australian Shoppers</h1>

<p>OzTrackers helps Australian collectors and shoppers find product restocks and time-limited deals. This short guide explains how our tracker network works, what notification channels are available, and how to get the best results quickly - whether you use email, SMS, or one of our partner Discord communities.</p>

<h2>What OzTrackers does</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monitors popular Australian retailers and marketplaces for product availability and price changes.</li>
  <li>Aggregates alerts into easy-to-consume notifications you control - email, SMS, or Discord.</li>
  <li>Provides curated tracker lists for common categories - TCG, toys, tech, and games.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notification channels</h2>
<h3>Email Alerts (free)</h3>
<p>Sign up to receive free email alerts for items you follow. Emails include the product name, store, link, and a short verification checklist so you can confirm stock before you buy.</p>

<h3>SMS Notifications (premium)</h3>
<p>For time-sensitive drops, SMS offers a fast push to your phone. SMS alerts contain a direct, tagged link to the store (where applicable) so you can act quickly.</p>

<h3>Partner Discord Communities (premium)</h3>
<p>Join partner Discord servers for live chat, community signals, and curated tracker channels. These paid communities often share local tips - like which store in your city tends to restock first.</p>

<h2>How tracking works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>We watch public product pages and inventory endpoints for changes to stock status and price.</li>
  <li>When a change matches your alert criteria (example: "in stock" at JB Hi-Fi), our system queues a notification.</li>
  <li>Notifications are verified with a lightweight additional check to reduce false positives.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example workflow</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to maximise your chances:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the alert for the specific product or SKU you want.</li>
  <li>Choose your notification channel - email for free, SMS for speed, Discord for community backup.</li>
  <li>Act fast - open the linked retailer page and confirm availability using the verification checklist in the alert.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Privacy and data usage</h2>
<p>We only store the minimal data required to deliver alerts - your email or phone number, the products you follow, and the notification preferences you choose. For more details see our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Common FAQ</h2>
<h3>Do you charge for alerts?</h3>
<p>Basic email alerts are free. Premium options like SMS and partner Discord access are paid.</p>

<h3>Can I use OzTrackers from outside Australia?</h3>
<p>Yes, but our retail coverage and timing are focused on Australian stores and marketplaces, so results will be best for Australia-based shoppers.</p>

<h3>Will OzTrackers buy the product for me?</h3>
<p>No - OzTrackers only notifies you. You remain responsible for completing purchases at the retailer.</p>
